# AI Cost Intelligence — Full Project Brief

## Overview

AI Cost Intelligence is a lightweight SaaS platform for AI SaaS founders and indie hackers to monitor AI API usage, feature profitability, operational efficiency, and AI-related business costs.

The platform focuses on:

- AI profitability visibility
- Feature-level cost analytics
- Operational AI intelligence
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Lightweight developer onboarding
- Actionable business insights

This is NOT:

- An observability platform
- A tracing platform
- A Langfuse clone
- Enterprise infrastructure monitoring
- A generic analytics dashboard

Core positioning:

> "Know which AI features are actually profitable."

---

# Core Product Philosophy

The product is designed for:

- founders
- operators
- bootstrapped AI startups
- indie hackers

NOT observability engineers.

The goal is to provide:

- financial clarity
- profitability visibility
- operational recommendations
- AI cost intelligence
- actionable insights

in a lightweight and understandable way.

The platform should help founders answer:

```txt
Which AI features are losing money?
Which prompts are unnecessarily expensive?
Which models are overused?
Which users destroy margins?
```

instead of simply:

```txt
How much did we spend?
```

---

# Product Goals

Help AI SaaS founders:

- Reduce AI infrastructure costs
- Identify expensive AI features
- Identify unprofitable users
- Optimize model usage
- Detect usage spikes
- Understand AI profitability

---

# Target Audience

## Primary Users

- Indie hackers
- Solo founders
- Small AI SaaS startups
- AI agencies
- Bootstrapped SaaS founders

---

# Example Customer Products

Products already using:

- OpenAI
- Claude
- Gemini
- OpenRouter
- Replicate
- ElevenLabs

Examples:

- AI PDF chat apps
- AI note apps
- AI summarizers
- AI content generators
- AI support bots
- AI image tools
- AI automation workflows

---

# Why Existing Provider Dashboards Are Not Enough

AI providers already provide:

- total spend
- billing history
- token usage
- model usage

However, they do NOT provide:

- cost per feature
- feature profitability
- cost per customer
- prompt efficiency insights
- operational recommendations
- cross-provider visibility
- AI business intelligence
- optimization suggestions

Example:

Provider dashboard:

```txt
OpenAI Spend: $1240
```

AI Cost Intelligence dashboard:

```txt
Resume Analyzer Feature
Revenue: $320
AI Costs: $441 ⚠

Main issue:
- prompts are too verbose
- GPT-5 overused
- estimated savings: 34%
```

The opportunity is NOT cost tracking.

The opportunity is:

> AI profitability intelligence.

---

# Main Pain Points

## 1. Founders only see total AI bills

Current provider dashboards usually show:

```txt
Total Spend: $812
```

But founders actually need:

- Cost per feature
- Cost per user
- Cost per workspace
- Feature profitability
- Optimization opportunities

---

## 2. Existing tools are too technical

Existing tools often focus on:

- traces
- observability
- evals
- telemetry
- debugging workflows
- engineering analytics

Current tools focus heavily on:

- Observability
- Traces
- Spans
- Evals
- Engineering workflows

Small founders often find them:

- Overkill
- Expensive
- Difficult to setup
- Infrastructure-heavy

---

## 3. AI costs scale faster than revenue

Common founder problems:

- One feature burns most AI costs
- Heavy users become unprofitable
- Expensive models are overused
- Inefficient prompts waste money

---

# Product Positioning

## NOT

- AI observability platform
- Telemetry platform
- Infrastructure debugging platform

---

## YES

- AI profitability tracker
- AI expense dashboard
- Feature cost analytics
- Business analytics for AI products

---

# Backend Architecture

Elysia.js routes handle:

- Event ingestion from SDK (`POST /track`)
- Public REST API
- Webhook endpoints
- Analytics queries
- Workspace management

---

# Core Product Flow

## Step 1 — Signup

User creates account.

Recommended auth:

- Magic link
- Google OAuth later

---

## Step 2 — Create Workspace

Workspace represents:

- Company
- SaaS project
- AI product

---

## Step 3 — Generate API Key

User receives:

- Tracker key
- Installation snippet

---

## Step 4 — Install SDK

```bash
pnpm add ai-cost-tracker
```

---

## Step 5 — Wrap AI Calls

Before:

```ts
const response = await openai.responses.create(...)
```

After:

```ts
const response = await trackedAI({
  feature: "pdf-chat",
  userId: user.id,
  run: async () => {
    return await openai.responses.create(...)
  }
})
```

DONE.

---

## Step 6 — Dashboard Analytics

Dashboard displays:

- Total spend
- Feature costs
- User-level costs
- Model usage
- Cost spikes
- Profitability analytics

---

# SDK Design

## SDK Philosophy

The SDK must be:

- Lightweight
- Simple
- Framework-agnostic
- Easy to setup
- Minimal configuration

Setup target:

> Under 10 minutes

---

## SDK Responsibilities

The SDK should:

- Execute original AI request
- Read token usage
- Estimate pricing
- Calculate latency
- Send analytics events

---

## SDK SHOULD NOT

- Store prompts by default
- Become proxy infrastructure
- Require OpenTelemetry
- Become observability layer

---

## Example SDK API

```ts
trackedAI({
  feature: "summary",
  userId: user.id,
  run: async () => {
    return await openai.responses.create(...)
  }
})
```

---

# Supported Providers

## MVP

- OpenAI
- OpenRouter
- Anthropic
- Gemini

---

# AI Intelligence Layer

## IMPORTANT

The platform does NOT only track analytics.

The platform should generate:

- operational recommendations
- profitability insights
- feature optimization suggestions
- model downgrade opportunities
- usage anomaly detection
- cost reduction suggestions

---

## AI Summary Philosophy

AI summaries should summarize structured analytics data.

NOT generate arbitrary prompt analysis.

The AI layer should analyze:

- token usage trends
- feature costs
- model usage
- latency
- request patterns
- response length
- prompt size

Then generate concise operational recommendations.

---

## Example AI Summary

```txt
The 'AI Search' feature generated 42% of total AI costs this week.

Most requests use GPT-5 despite short prompts and low response complexity.

Switching to GPT-5-mini may reduce costs by an estimated 31%.
```

---

## Prompt Optimization Scope

The platform may optionally analyze:

- prompt length
- response length
- repeated prompt patterns
- excessive context usage
- high-cost request structures

The goal is NOT autonomous prompt engineering.

The goal is:

- operational optimization
- cost reduction
- profitability improvement

---

# Performance Guidelines

## IMPORTANT

Avoid overengineering.

---

## Recommended Practices

### 1. Batch Inserts

DO NOT insert every event individually.

Better:

```txt
batch 20-100 events
→ bulk insert
```

Benefits:

- Lower DB cost
- Faster ingestion
- Fewer connections

---

### 2. Aggregate Metrics Daily

DO NOT query millions of raw events directly.

Create:

```txt
daily_metrics
```

Example:

```txt
workspace_id
date
feature
total_cost
total_requests
```

This massively improves dashboard performance.

---

### 3. Avoid Prompt Storage Initially

Store only:

- Token counts
- Metadata
- Feature tags

Avoid:

- Full prompts
- Full responses

Benefits:

- Lower storage cost
- Fewer privacy issues
- Simpler architecture

---

### 4. Cache Pricing Tables

Model pricing should stay:

- In memory
- Or cached

Avoid repeated DB lookups.

---

### 5. Use Server Components

Recommended for:

- Dashboard pages
- Analytics pages
- Auth pages

Benefits:

- Less client JS
- Faster loads
- Cheaper rendering

---

# Security Guidelines

## IMPORTANT

The platform handles:

- API metadata
- Customer identifiers
- Workspace analytics

Security matters.

---

## Recommended Security Practices

### 1. Enable Supabase RLS

Mandatory.

Every table should use:

- Row Level Security
- Workspace-based access control

---

### 2. Separate Supabase Clients

Use:

- Browser client
- Server client
- Admin/service-role client

---

### 3. NEVER Expose Service Role Keys

Only server-side.

Never client-side.

---

### 4. Workspace Isolation

Every query should validate:

```sql
workspace_id = current_workspace
```

---

### 5. Encrypt API Keys

Tracker keys encrypted at rest.

---

### 6. Signed SDK Requests

Prevent fake analytics submissions.

---

### 7. Rate Limiting

Protect:

```txt
/api/track
```

against abuse.

---

### 8. Input Validation

Validate:

- Token values
- Feature names
- Payload size
- Request schema

---

### 9. Avoid Prompt Storage by Default

Huge privacy win.

---

# Reports & Notifications

Reports and alerts are core engagement features.

Dashboard-only products often have weak retention.

Reports create recurring engagement.

---

## Supported Notification Channels

- Telegram
- Email
- Discord later
- Slack later

---

## Example Reports

```txt
Weekly AI Cost Report

- Total spend increased 14%
- AI Search feature became unprofitable
- GPT-5 usage heavily increased
- Estimated optimization savings: $82
```

---

## Example Alerts

```txt
⚠ Sudden AI cost spike detected
⚠ GPT-5 overusage detected
⚠ Feature profitability dropped below threshold
⚠ Prompt size unusually high
```

---

# Cross-Provider Intelligence

Many AI startups use:

- OpenAI
- OpenRouter
- Anthropic
- Gemini
- Replicate
- Together AI

Provider dashboards are fragmented.

The platform should unify:

- costs
- analytics
- profitability
- optimization insights

across providers.

# Risk Mitigation

## Risk 1: SDK Adoption Friction

**Problem:** Developers hesitant to add SDK to production code

**Impact:** Low activation rate, high drop-off

**Mitigation:**

- One-line installation: `pnpm add ai-cost-intelligence`
- Zero-config default setup
- Comprehensive docs with copy-paste examples
- Video tutorials (2-3 minutes)
- Live chat support during setup
- Sandbox environment for testing
- Production-safety guarantees (fail-silent)
- Open-source SDK for transparency

**Success Metric:** >60% activation rate

---

## Risk 2: Low Willingness to Pay

**Problem:** Indie hackers price-sensitive, may prefer free alternatives

**Impact:** Low conversion rate, unsustainable business

**Mitigation:**

- Generous free tier (10k events/month)
- Clear ROI demonstration:
  - "Save $82/month in AI costs"
  - "Pay $29, save $200+"
- Monthly cost optimization reports
- Savings calculator on landing page
- Testimonials showing real savings
- Lifetime deal for early adopters
- Money-back guarantee (30 days)

**Success Metric:** >10% free-to-paid conversion

---

## Risk 3: Competitor Response

**Problem:** Langfuse/Helicone add profitability features

**Impact:** Differentiation weakens, harder to compete

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on speed & simplicity (hard to copy)
- Build strong brand & community (moat)
- Continuous feature innovation
- Strong customer relationships
- Founder-focused positioning (not engineering)
- Superior onboarding experience
- Better pricing for indie hackers
- Cross-provider intelligence (complex to replicate)

**Success Metric:** <5% churn to competitors

---

## Risk 4: Provider API Changes

**Problem:** OpenAI/Anthropic change response format or pricing

**Impact:** SDK breaks, cost calculations wrong

**Mitigation:**

- Modular provider adapters (easy to update)
- Automated pricing updates (scrape provider pages)
- Fallback to manual pricing entry
- Community-contributed pricing data
- Version pinning with graceful degradation
- Monitoring for API changes
- Fast response time (<24 hours for fixes)

**Success Metric:** <1 hour downtime per incident

---

## Risk 5: Data Privacy Concerns

**Problem:** Users worried about prompt/response data storage

**Impact:** Low trust, low adoption

**Mitigation:**

- Default: NO prompt storage (only metadata)
- Opt-in prompt storage (explicit consent)
- Clear privacy policy
- SOC 2 compliance (future)
- Data encryption at rest
- Workspace data isolation
- GDPR compliance
- Self-hosted option (future, enterprise)

**Success Metric:** <5% users cite privacy as concern

---

## Risk 6: Scaling Costs

**Problem:** Analytics event storage grows faster than revenue

**Impact:** Negative unit economics

**Mitigation:**

- Batch inserts (20-100 events)
- Daily aggregation (reduce raw event queries)
- Automatic data retention (90 days free, 1 year paid)
- Efficient indexing strategy
- Supabase → ClickHouse migration path (if needed)
- Usage-based pricing tiers
- Cost monitoring & alerts

**Success Metric:** Infrastructure cost <20% of revenue

---

## Risk 7: Low Retention

**Problem:** Users sign up but don't return

**Impact:** High churn, low LTV

**Mitigation:**

- Weekly email reports (recurring engagement)
- Telegram/Discord alerts (real-time engagement)
- Cost spike notifications (urgent value)
- Optimization recommendations (actionable value)
- Onboarding email sequence
- In-app notifications
- Gamification (cost savings leaderboard)
- Community building (Discord)

**Success Metric:** >40% weekly active users

---

## Risk 8: Feature Bloat

**Problem:** Try to compete with Langfuse on observability

**Impact:** Lose focus, confuse users, slow development

**Mitigation:**

- Strict product philosophy: "profitability intelligence"
- Say NO to observability features
- Focus on founder needs, not engineer needs
- Regular product roadmap reviews
- Customer feedback prioritization
- Keep UI simple & focused
- Avoid feature creep

**Success Metric:** <5 core features in MVP
